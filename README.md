# Operating Systems Student implements a Paging System!
I, the PlacidFireball, wrote this code (in Rust) to complete a homework assignment at Montana State University.
I tried my best to comment it so it made sense. It all had to be in one source file so I appologize for the spaghetti nature of it all.

I converted this code over from a C source file because I got tired of SIGSEGV, so some of the structure may feel C-like, sorry about that. I wrote this code using CLion from JetBrains.

A quick note, my github ettiquete is quite bad so sometimes I commit changes that won't compile. Hopefully when you run into this it compiles.
